      "description": "My name is Jordan Covington and I am a veteran of the US Air Force. I have worked various IT jobs for the Air Force and Navy over the past 15 years. I have two Bachelor's degrees in Business Administration and Computer Information Systems as well as an IT Service Management and Comptia Security+ certifications.I am currently enrolled in a Software Development course which I will be graduating from in May and I continue to serve in the Alaskan Air National Guard where I am the Supervisor for the Server Operations office and currently hold a Top Secret Security Clearance. I am in the process of transitioning my career into web development because while in college I learned that I enjoyed computer programming. Problem solving skills, curiousity and a desire to innovate are things I have always excelled at so coding became an instant passion of mine. Coupling these traits with a constant desire to learn makes me a valuable asset to have in a work center.",
